# Project [ConquestAce](http://www.conquestace.com/)

This project is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and contains a few experimental interfaces.

## Wildcard Prompt Generator

Visit `/wildcards` to upload wildcard `.txt` files and generate prompts. The selected files are parsed in the browser and sent to `/api/prompt` for processing. At the moment the server replies with a placeholder message but demonstrates how wildcard data can be collected.
