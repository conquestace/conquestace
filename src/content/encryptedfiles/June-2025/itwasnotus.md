## **It Was Not Us**

It began with a whisper across the border—something once dormant, now exhumed. A **"3 % digital levy"** cast upon unseen networks. Ancestral circuits — Amazon, Apple, Google — felt the tremor. Yet neither side claims the spark.

A decree, typed into the digital void:

> **“Terminating ALL discussions … effective immediately.”**
> Seven days’ notice: an unnamed toll to come.
> Silence follows — but markets shiver.

To the north, a lone figure stands by a fractured table:
**“We will continue.”**
Words lodged in fractured frameworks, negotiating in the best interests of shadows.

Meanwhile, steel and autos, once cogs in a silent machine, now clang under layers of tariffs—twenty‑five, fifty, unknown percentages. Borders, once mere lines, morph into thickets of supply‑chain riddles.

The world watches. Wall Street smiles—a record high amid tremors, as if it knows a secret others do not ([politico.com][1], [washingtonpost.com][2]).

Eyes dart across time:

* **June 27, 2025** — the cut‑off date.
* **30 June** — when the digital tax draws its first blood ([apnews.com][3]).

Importers and exporters straddle unspoken fault lines.
It is said that **“economic power”** is wielded like a broadsword—but who carries it?
North says: *we stand firm*.
South replies: *we hold all cards* ([en.wikipedia.org][4]).

And in the swirl of threats and counters—autos, steel, aluminium, data streams—one truth lingers in the static:
**It was not us.**

But who then lit the fuse?
